class_name ArmyEvenSplit
## Creates [ActionArmySplit]s and [ActionArmyMovement]s
## such that the given [Army] is evenly split and moved to
## all given destination [Province]s.


## If there are more targets than available troops,
## then no split will occur, and this property will stay null.

## This array will always be the same size as the number of given
## destination provinces, and they will be in the same order too.
## But, there is no guarantee that any of the actions are valid.
## For example, if you provide a province the army cannot reach,
## then an invalid action will be created anyway.
