# grand-strategy-game (placeholder name)
A grand strategy game made in Godot.\
What makes it stand out is that you can adjust the game's rules to your liking.\
Other noteworthy features: local & online multiplayer; saving/loading; custom map support; chat & chat commands; a working AI.

It's still a work in progress, though. It's missing important quality of life stuff, it doesn't have a built-in map/scenario editor, and it's missing a lot of game mechanics.
