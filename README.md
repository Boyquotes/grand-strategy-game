## Grand Strategy Game (placeholder name)
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/SamTheBlow/grand-strategy-game/releases/latest)

This is an ambitious project that aims to be the grand strategy game to end all grand strategy games.\
It can be used as a sandbox, as a game engine, or just to play games.

But, it is still in early development. It has almost no graphics, and it's missing a lot of features.

In its current state, what makes it stand out is that you can adjust the game's rules to your liking.\
Other noteworthy features: local & online multiplayer; custom map support; chat & chat commands; several AI types and personalities.

It's already fun to play, so feel free to give it a try!
